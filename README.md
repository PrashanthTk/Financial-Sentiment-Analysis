Experiments to train my own Word2vec embeddings for Transfer Learning using Attention Models. ( Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning)
Involves experimenting with Stanford Question Answering Dataset and Transfer Learning.
The idea behind these experiments is to use Transfer Learning for Unsupervised Text Data with Deep Neural Networks and Attention Models.
Code for my trained word2vec embedding will be added later
Libraries:
Keras,python, pandas, nltk Tensorflow and a little bit of sci-kit learn here and there
